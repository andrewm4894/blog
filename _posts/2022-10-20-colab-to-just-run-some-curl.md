Here is a little google colab notebook to just paste in some `curl` command and get the response back into a json dictionary.

This can be handy when working with backend and frontend engineers who might be using a different language than you and just send you some curl commands that you want to explore results of more in python.

No command line messing around - just pop into a colab!
