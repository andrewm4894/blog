I have been working a bit lately with some text classification stuff using Hugging Face - its great n all but their docs can actually be a bit overwhelming.

So here is a minimal text classification example, using huggingface and either pytorch or tensorflow (you decide).

Will try to update and maintain the colab here: https://github.com/andrewm4894/colabs/blob/master/huggingface\_text\_classification\_quickstart.ipynb
