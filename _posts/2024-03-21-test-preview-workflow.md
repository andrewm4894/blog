# Testing Our New Preview Workflow

This is a test post to verify that our new PR preview workflow is working correctly. When this post is submitted as a PR, we should see:

1. The workflow running automatically
2. A preview deployment being created
3. A comment on the PR with the preview URL

## Some Sample Content

Here's some sample content to make the post more interesting:

### Code Sample

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello from the preview deployment!"
end
```

### Markdown Features

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for style
- > A blockquote for good measure

### Image Test

![Jekyll Logo](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png)

## What's Next?

If this preview works well, we can:
1. Merge the PR
2. Delete the preview deployment automatically
3. See the post on the main site

Let's see how it looks in the preview!
