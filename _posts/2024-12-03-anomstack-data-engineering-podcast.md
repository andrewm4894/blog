I was recently on the [Data Engineering Podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/) to chat about anomaly detection and a open source side project im working on - [anomstack](https://github.com/andrewm4894/anomstack).

You can listen to it [here](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/anomstack-open-source-business-metric-anomaly-detection-episode-404) or just search "anomstack data eng" in wherever you listen to podcasts.
