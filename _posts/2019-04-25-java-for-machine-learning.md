I've recently been learning java for machine learning related work (a long story to do with mainframes, and you know, why not).

Decided to stick down in here some resources i found very useful as i found i still needed to do a bit of Googling to find ML related Java tutorials and moocs i found useful. Will add to this post as i discover more stuff.

### General Java Intro Stuff

- [This coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) was really good for really intro 'Hello World' type stuff.
- [Great playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5471F7B9DF756118) of hands on practical java examples. Seems to be loads more at his site too: https://javavids.com/

### Machine Learning Related

- [Great playlist of youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o19TPn181g&list=PLea0WJq13cnBVfsPVNyRAus2NK-KhCuzJ) going through lots of Weka api examples. Corresponding github repo is [here](https://github.com/nsadawi/WEKA-API).
- The [Weka api docs](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/use_weka_in_your_java_code/) are pretty good too.
- Great [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sQcOOtehY&list=PL9iheGibFMtrJZJFrTIdd-QNQyjDX5v2X&index=11) from [skymind](https://skymind.ai/) on datavec and dl4j. The [dl4j examples repo](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples) is also worth cloning and playing around with.

### Testing in Java

Found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8XXfgF9GSc) pretty good on junit. And [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFI19lj4OM) from intelij if that's your IDE.

### Java IDE's

This was one of the hardest parts - finding my way around IDE's like eclipse and intelij. They are super powerful but a very different experience to something like jupyter lab or visual studio with python.

I'm using intelij IDEA and they have some good videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/intellijideavideo/playlists).

### Maven

- Found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNGQ9JBQWhQ&feature=youtu.be) a nice clear explanation of maven. (Actually he seems to have lots of [cool other stuff](https://www.youtube.com/user/discospiff/playlists) too).

### Other Useful/Interesting Stuff

- Why Java and the JVM Will Dominate the Future of Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data ([youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytja2JuVMlw)).
- [Awesome-java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java) list.
- [Edureka video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYXivKMSEqM) on typical Java interview questions which i found useful.
