What a time to be alive when nerds like us can geek out every week listening to leaders in the field chatting about what their favourite coffee is and all the cool stuff they are working on!

This is required listening for anyone working with data - really great sort of inside baseball stuff too that you get via tidbits here and there as you listen that really all compounds over time.

And also Demetrios the host is glorious!

I always have it at the top of podcasts and YouTube channels I recommend to anyone in data from students starting off to old timers like myself (I'm embracing it).

Also the site and platform is really cool too: [https://mlops.community/](https://mlops.community/)

p.s. i write this post after about an hour trying to find one single decent platform (except apple obviously) to leave a review to try show support for the show. In the end it was too painful so I wrote this ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
