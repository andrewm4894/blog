Maybe i missed something but i could not find any easy and simple out of the box ways to just save Keras `[model.summary()](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/v3.0.5/keras/models/model.py#L217)` and `[plot_model()](https://keras.io/api/utils/model_plotting_utils/#plotmodel-function)` outputs to [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site).

So below is one little recipie to do this, feel free to use and adapt however suits your needs.
