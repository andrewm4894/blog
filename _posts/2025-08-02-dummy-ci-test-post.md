This is a dummy blog post created to test the CI preview functionality on feature branches.

## Why This Post Exists

This post serves as a test case to verify that:
- GitHub Actions workflows properly trigger on feature branches
- Preview deployments are working correctly
- The Jekyll build process handles new posts appropriately

## Some Dummy Content

Here's some placeholder content to make this look like a real blog post:

### Code Example
```python
def dummy_function():
    return "Hello from the dummy CI test!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(dummy_function())
```

### List of Things
- Testing CI/CD pipelines
- Verifying preview deployments
- Making sure Jekyll builds work
- Checking that feature branches trigger workflows

## Conclusion

If you're reading this in a preview deployment, then the CI is working! ðŸŽ‰

This post can be safely deleted once the CI testing is complete.
