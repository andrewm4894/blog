<p>Arrrgghh - I just wasted the best part of an afternoon chasing this one down. If i can knock out a quick post on it then at least i’ll feel i’ve gotten something out of it.</p>

<p>Here’s the story - somewhere in an admittedly crazy ETL type pipeline i was using pandas <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html">pct_change()</a> as a data transformation prior to some downstream modelling. Problem was i was also using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html">dropna()</a> later to ensure only valid data going into the model. I noticed a lot of rows falling out of the data pipeline (print(df<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.shape.html">.shape</a>) is your friend!).</p>

<p>After a lot of debugging, chasing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36285546/pandas-pct-change-function-returning-wrong-value">this dead end</a> down a rabbit hole, cleaning and updating my conda environment (and then dealing with the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4439">tornado issues</a> that always seems to cause) i realized the answer was staring me in the face the whole time.</p>

<p>Its the 0’s!</p>

<p>Turns out my data has lots of zero’s and i’m an idiot who assumed (0-0) / 0 = 0 and so the NaN’s above should be 0.</p>

<p>But am i really an idiot? I checked…</p>

<p>I guess so.</p>

<p>So let that be a lesson - watch out for 0’s when using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html">pct_change()</a> - don’t be like andrewm4894.</p>

<p>p.s. I could not just fillna() them as i had valid NaN’s at the top of my dataframe from the lagged values. So i ended up in a state where some NaN’s were valid and some i wanted to be 0 instead. Am guessing i’ll have to write a custom pct_change() type function (which seems a bit crazy). Would be great if was a way to tell pandas pct_change() i want (0-0)/0=0. Maybe if i get brave enough i’ll make a pull request :)</p>

<p>p.p.s. Seems like i’m not the only one: https://brilliant.org/wiki/what-is-0-0/ (though still wrong)</p>

<p>hmmm - maybe i’ve just wasted more time on this post. Think i need to pack it in for today.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Everything is always clearer in the morning, here is a one liner that pretty much behaves as i wanted. I can get back to my life now.</p>
