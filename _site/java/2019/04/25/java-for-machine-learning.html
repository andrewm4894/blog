<p>I’ve recently been learning java for machine learning related work (a long story to do with mainframes, and you know, why not).</p>

<p>Decided to stick down in here some resources i found very useful as i found i still needed to do a bit of Googling to find ML related Java tutorials and moocs i found useful. Will add to this post as i discover more stuff.</p>

<h3 id="general-java-intro-stuff">General Java Intro Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming">This coursera course</a> was really good for really intro ‘Hello World’ type stuff.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5471F7B9DF756118">Great playlist</a> of hands on practical java examples. Seems to be loads more at his site too: https://javavids.com/</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="machine-learning-related">Machine Learning Related</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o19TPn181g&amp;list=PLea0WJq13cnBVfsPVNyRAus2NK-KhCuzJ">Great playlist of youtube videos</a> going through lots of Weka api examples. Corresponding github repo is <a href="https://github.com/nsadawi/WEKA-API">here</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/use_weka_in_your_java_code/">Weka api docs</a> are pretty good too.</li>
  <li>Great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5sQcOOtehY&amp;list=PL9iheGibFMtrJZJFrTIdd-QNQyjDX5v2X&amp;index=11">youtube tutorials</a> from <a href="https://skymind.ai/">skymind</a> on datavec and dl4j. The <a href="https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples">dl4j examples repo</a> is also worth cloning and playing around with.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testing-in-java">Testing in Java</h3>

<p>Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8XXfgF9GSc">this video</a> pretty good on junit. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFI19lj4OM">this one</a> from intelij if that’s your IDE.</p>

<h3 id="java-ides">Java IDE’s</h3>

<p>This was one of the hardest parts - finding my way around IDE’s like eclipse and intelij. They are super powerful but a very different experience to something like jupyter lab or visual studio with python.</p>

<p>I’m using intelij IDEA and they have some good videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/intellijideavideo/playlists">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="maven">Maven</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNGQ9JBQWhQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">this video</a> a nice clear explanation of maven. (Actually he seems to have lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/discospiff/playlists">cool other stuff</a> too).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-usefulinteresting-stuff">Other Useful/Interesting Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Why Java and the JVM Will Dominate the Future of Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytja2JuVMlw">youtube video</a>).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java">Awesome-java</a> list.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYXivKMSEqM">Edureka video</a> on typical Java interview questions which i found useful.</li>
</ul>
