<p>This is just a quick one to save anyone else new to the <a href="https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/use_weka_in_your_java_code/">Weka api in Java</a> spending as much time as i did figuring this one out.</p>

<p>Lets suppose you have a weka instances object and a new list of values you want to add into it as a new attribute (weka slang for a new column in your data).</p>

<p>Below gist shows a small reproducible example of this.</p>

<p>https://gist.github.com/andrewm4894/9e78efeb96921e5272ae2d1d2d603fef</p>

<p>And you should see some output like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>====== BEFORE ====== sepallength,sepalwidth,petallength,petalwidth,class 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.9,3,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa 5,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa====== AFTER ====== sepallength,sepalwidth,petallength,petalwidth,class,randomDouble 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa,0.173003 4.9,3,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa,0.304703 4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa,0.925626 4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa,0.733839 5,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa,0.710073
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Above we can see the new attribute “randomDouble” has been added to the instances object.</p>

<p>I’m learning the weka java api at the moment so will try post little tidbits like this that could be useful for others of even myself 6 months from now :)</p>
