<p>I discovered <a href="https://github.com/malloydata/malloy">Malloy</a> recently in <a href="https://youtu.be/zmmJgwc3oPI">this great talk</a>, it seems like a really interesting idea (a higher level abstraction or DSL on top of sql) with some great people behind it (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lloydtabb/">looker founder</a> who seems to really know his stuff).</p>

<p>So I decided to try get going with it in as minimal a way as possible using everyone’s favourite dataset.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy">https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy</a></p>

<p>To get going all you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=malloydata.malloy-vscode">malloy vscode extension</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that’s pretty much it, each .malloy or .malloynb file will make it obvious how to run queries or run usual notebook style flow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="moving-parts">Moving parts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy/blob/main/titanic/titanic.source.malloy">source object</a> defining some sort of data connection (in this case just a local csv) and, optionally, some additional measures and dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy/blob/main/titanic/titanic.queries.malloy">queries</a> against a source. This is where i think it essentially becomes a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> (and more) on top of SQL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>optionally some <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy/blob/main/titanic/titanic.styles.json">style objects</a> that can help map queries to output visualisations. This is what’s behind the magic of some of the default visualizations in the cool demos <a href="https://github.com/malloydata/try-malloy">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>even the ability to bring it all together into a familiar <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/learn-malloy/blob/main/titanic/titanic.notebook.malloynb">notebook</a> experience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial thoughts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Seems like a really interesting project and idea (no doubt a lot has been learned from look.ml and those learnings will be baked into this project).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seems to have a lot of the abstractions right imo - feels natural in some sense while also still quite flexible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was able to just guess about 70% of what I wanted or expected when writing some example queries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can’t wait until I can use this natively in something like BigQuery UI and easily share results of analysis with co-workers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seem to be a cool use case for duckdb in my csv example - need to learn more how that’s all working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I could see this becoming a nice standard way to package up and share analysis type projects with bosses and colleagues in a way that they can easily then play with, customize and build on if they have follow on questions - so i no longer become the bottleneck - great!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could also see this be quite a useful tool to translate and define business questions with stakeholders without having to show them any sql!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of my hot takes over last few years was that SQL is the new excel, but maybe Malloy could also be the new excel.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
