<p>Here is a little google colab notebook to just paste in some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> command and get the response back into a json dictionary.</p>

<p>This can be handy when working with backend and frontend engineers who might be using a different language than you and just send you some curl commands that you want to explore results of more in python.</p>

<p>No command line messing around - just pop into a colab!</p>
