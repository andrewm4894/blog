<p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is magic, i may be a little late to the game on this one and i’m sure it has it’s fair share of haters (i’ve seen <a href="https://medium.com/@hbarcelos/how-i-learnt-to-love-and-hate-terraform-in-the-past-few-weeks-db085d012882">some have a love hate relationship with it</a>, maybe i’m still in my honeymoon period).</p>

<p>But from my point of view as a Data Scientist/ML Engineer playing around with various services in a multi-cloud environment (mainly GCP and AWS) its one of the things that keeps me sane in a sea of changing features and web ui’s that the cloud providers love to throw at us.</p>

<p>When it comes to cloud projects i’m working with, if its not under source control and managed by terraform then i don’t want to know about it.</p>

<p>So as I’ve been on my voyage of discovery with terraform i decided to put it to use in a little side project I’ve been wanting to do for a while.</p>

<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: All code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links">reddit-links Github repo</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="the-set-up">The Set Up</h2>

<p>The idea is to have a cloud function that runs each day, looks at top posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning">r/MachineLearning</a>, pulls out all links, and some metadata, and then saves those links somewhere useful.</p>

<p>My original goal (and something i might get to at some stage) was to pull all YouTube links shared on r/MachineLearning that have a decent score into an automatic playlist on YouTube or maybe automatically add them to my own watch later playlist. I have the data now so this might be an easy enough next project.</p>

<p>So given the goal above here are the various moving parts I’ve picked to use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terraform</strong>: To manage all the GCP stuff used.</li>
  <li><strong>GCP Cloud Function</strong>: This will be the code that pulls from r/MachineLearning, wrangles the text and html data from reddit, pulls out the links and then either inserts or updates Airtable accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>GCP PubSub Topic</strong>: This will be the trigger for the cloud function.</li>
  <li><strong>GCP Cloud Scheduler</strong>: This will run a sort of cron job in GCP each day to push a message to the pubsub topic which will in turn trigger the cloud function.</li>
  <li><strong>Airtable</strong>: This is where the data will be stored and published from. I had considered a GCP bucket but Airtable is much easier to share and a bit more user friendly for anyone who might want to use the links pulled from reddit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Once you work with and set up a Terraform project once then its pretty straight forward. I have used <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless</a> for some cloud functions before but i like the way terraform gives you everything GCP or AWS or Azure etc have to offer at your fingertips once you invest that little bit of learning up front.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the .tf files i’m using and what they all do. There are of course many ways to set things up in Terraform but this seemed like a straightforward enough way and works for me for smaller projects like this.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/backend.tf"><strong>backend.tf</strong></a> - this is optional and used to have a remote <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/gcs.html">backend</a> for the state of your project as opposed to somewhere on your laptop.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/conf_example.tf">conf.tf</a></strong> - this is a file i’m using to define any sensitive variables in terraform that i don’t want to go into source control (make sure you add to .gitignore) but need to make available to terraform to do it’s stuff. I have included an <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/conf_example.tf">conf_example.tf</a> file in the repo to show how this looks.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/variables.tf">variables.tf</a></strong> - used to define other variables used by terraform.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/provider.tf">provider.tf</a></strong> - conventional file to define the cloud <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html">providers</a> you want to be able to use.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/gcp-cloud-functions.tf">gcp-cloud-functions.tf</a></strong> - this is where we will define all the things we need related to our <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">Cloud Functions</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/gcp-cloud-scheduler.tf">gcp-cloud-scheduler.tf</a></strong> - used to define the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler">Cloud Scheduler</a> cron jobs we need.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/gcp-pubsub-topics.tf"><strong>gcp-pubsub-topics.tf</strong></a> - used to define the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">PubSub</a> topics that will trigger the cloud function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gcp-function---redditlinks">GCP Function - redditlinks</h2>

<p>The function used to pull from reddit is below. It might be a little verbose and could probably be refactored a little but hey - it works. Mainly using the <a href="https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PRAW</a> library to pull from reddit, some usual data wrangling libraries, and then the <a href="https://github.com/gtalarico/airtable-python-wrapper">airtable-python-wrapper</a> library to insert/update records in Airtable.</p>

<p>https://gist.github.com/andrewm4894/dbea54c122d8f3dd4e2695887e337567</p>

<h2 id="end-results---airtable">End Results - Airtable</h2>

<p>The end results of all this being a cloud function that runs once a day to update or insert records into <a href="https://airtable.com/shrCe8ZWuLJpHNiG8">this Airtable</a>. Then from that i have made some views for links from specific domains.</p>

<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: If you wanted to do this but for a different subreddit then you should need to make minimal changes once you have your terraform variables all set up - primarily changing or adding another cloud scheduler job to <a href="https://github.com/andrewm4894/reddit-links/blob/master/terraform/gcp-cloud-scheduler.tf">here</a> with the relevant params, as well as making sure all keys etc you need are available in the right places).</p>
