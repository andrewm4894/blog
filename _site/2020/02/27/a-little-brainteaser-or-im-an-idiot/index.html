<p>This took me waaay too long to work out today and i was thinking it could make a nice little interview coding type question (which i’d probably fail).</p>

<p>Suppose you have 10,000 rows of data and need to continually train and retrain a model training on at most 1,000 rows at a time and retraining the model every 500 rows, can you tell me how many “batches” of data this will create and the start and end index of each batch?</p>

<p>So thats:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>n = 10000
train_max = 1000
train_every = 500
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we want a dictionary like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  1: {"start": 1, "end": 1000},
  2: {"start": 500, "end": 1000}, 
  ...
  ?: {"start": ?, "end": ?},
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After doing some crazy loops in python for a while I decided to go back to basics and do it <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1129548020066820096">Jeremy Howard style</a> in excel (well gsheets - i’m not a savage) - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ggpRczKPmPGFiCFgnvb35CPDN21l7NuY53Blkm92Rg8/edit#gid=0">gsheet</a>.</p>

<p>And here is my Python solution:</p>

<p>…I’m pretty sure someone will come along with a super pythonic one liner that shows maybe i am an idiot after all.</p>

<p>Ok now back to work.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Actually i think what i want is more something like the below where you can define a minimum and maximum size of your training data and then roll that over your data.</p>
