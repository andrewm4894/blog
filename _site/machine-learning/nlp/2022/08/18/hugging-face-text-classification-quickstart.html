<p>I have been working a bit lately with some text classification stuff using Hugging Face - its great n all but their docs can actually be a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>So here is a minimal text classification example, using huggingface and either pytorch or tensorflow (you decide).</p>

<p>Will try to update and maintain the colab here: https://github.com/andrewm4894/colabs/blob/master/huggingface_text_classification_quickstart.ipynb</p>
